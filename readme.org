* About

A permissively licensed modern implementation of Gauss-Jacobi quadrature.
** Usage
The most automated approach is to use the ~conda~ environment and ~fpm~ build:
#+begin_src bash
micromamba create -f environment.yml
micromamba activate gaussjacquad
fpm build
#+end_src
** Testing
An analytic result can be obtained from the ~scripts~ folder.
#+begin_src bash
python scripts/gen_analytic_vals.py
fpm test
#+end_src

** Development
*** Developing locally
A ~pre-commit~ job is setup on CI to enforce consistent styles, so it is best to
set it up locally as well (using [[https://pypa.github.io/pipx][pipx]] for isolation):

#+begin_src sh
# Run before commiting
pipx run pre-commit run --all-files
# Or install the git hook to enforce this
pipx run pre-commit install
#+end_src
