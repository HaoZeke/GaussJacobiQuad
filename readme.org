* About

A permissively licensed modern implementation of Gauss-Jacobi quadrature.

* Development
** Developing locally
A ~pre-commit~ job is setup on CI to enforce consistent styles, so it is best to
set it up locally as well (using [[https://pypa.github.io/pipx][pipx]] for isolation):

#+begin_src sh
# Run before commiting
pipx run pre-commit run --all-files
# Or install the git hook to enforce this
pipx run pre-commit install
#+end_src
